A basic CRUD Application developed using JS stack.

This is created as a part of the Udemy Course by Brad Traversy.

This Project uses Nodejs as a Backend with Express as router and serving HTML using Handlebars template engine.

This is fairly a simple app that incorporates authentication of the user using Passportjs.
